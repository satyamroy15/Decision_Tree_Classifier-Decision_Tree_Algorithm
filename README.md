# Decision Tree Classifier with Tree Visualization

** Project done during the Data Science & Analytics Internship at The Sparks Foundation **

## **Task 4 - Decision Tree Algorithm - Decision Tree Classifier**
Task: For the given ‘Iris’ dataset, create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically. The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.

* Libraries Used: Scikit Learn, Pandas, Pydotplus
* Dataset: Iris Dataset
